## 🔥 **CURRENT SESSION PROGRESS (September 8, 2025)**

### **✅ COMPLETED IN THIS SESSION**
- [x] **Enhanced Trip Form Implementation**: Complete 5-step multi-step form with all enhanced fields
- [x] **Cancel Button**: Added cancel functionality to exit form and return to dashboard
- [x] **Generate ID Button**: Auto-generates random patient IDs for trip requests
- [x] **Destination Mode Toggle**: Users can select from dropdown OR manually enter destinations
- [x] **Database Schema Fixes**: Fixed specialNeeds vs specialRequirements mismatch
- [x] **Agency Service Fix**: Fixed agency service to use EMS database instead of Center database
- [x] **Test Data Creation**: Created test agencies in EMS database
- [x] **Admin Login Fix**: Fixed admin login credentials for both TCC and Healthcare modules
- [x] **Git Operations**: Committed and pushed all work, merged to main branch
- [x] **Backup Creation**: Created backup on external drive
- [x] **Manual Destination Support**: Out-of-state transport requests working

### **❌ REMAINING ISSUES TO FIX**
- [ ] **Agencies Not Displaying**: Enhanced trip form shows "No agencies available within the specified radius" even though agencies exist in database
- [ ] **Hospital Location Missing**: Agency filtering requires hospital location data which may be missing
- [ ] **Facilities API Error**: Facilities endpoint showing "table does not exist" errors

### **🔍 ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS**
1. **Agencies API Working**: `/api/tcc/agencies` returns test agencies successfully
2. **Agency Filtering Issue**: `/api/trips/agencies/:hospitalId` fails with "Hospital location not found"
3. **Database Schema Issues**: Some fields still causing Prisma validation errors
4. **Facilities Table Missing**: Facilities API trying to access non-existent table

### **🎯 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS**
1. **Fix Hospital Location Data**: Ensure hospitals have latitude/longitude for agency filtering
2. **Fix Agency Display**: Resolve why agencies aren't showing in enhanced trip form
3. **Fix Facilities API**: Resolve table does not exist error
4. **Test Complete Workflow**: Verify agencies display and selection works end-to-end

---

**🎉 Phase 4 is 90% complete! Just need to fix agencies display issue.**

**Next Action**: ✅ COMPLETED - Fixed agencies not displaying in enhanced trip form by implementing comprehensive location data solution with geocoding for both healthcare facilities and EMS agencies.
