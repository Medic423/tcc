# TCC Phase 5 - Route Optimization Implementation

## 🎯 **PROJECT CONTEXT**

**Current Status**: Phase 4 Complete - TCC Trips View Implementation ✅
**Next Phase**: Phase 5 - Advanced Features & Production Readiness
**Focus**: Route Optimization Implementation (Most Critical Feature)

## 📋 **CURRENT SYSTEM STATUS**

### ✅ **Completed Features**
- **TCC Trips View**: Comprehensive trip management interface with advanced filtering
- **End-to-End Data Flow**: Complete trip lifecycle working (creation → TCC → EMS → status updates)
- **Multi-User System**: Admin, Healthcare, and EMS dashboards fully functional
- **Database Architecture**: 3-siloed databases (Center, EMS, Hospital) working perfectly
- **Real-time Updates**: 30-second auto-refresh across all dashboards
- **Trip Management**: Complete workflow from creation to completion

### 🔧 **Existing Route Optimization Code**
The codebase already contains sophisticated route optimization algorithms:

**Backend Services**:
- `backend/src/services/revenueOptimizer.ts` - Revenue optimization with scoring algorithm
- `backend/src/services/backhaulDetector.ts` - Backhaul pairing detection
- `backend/src/routes/optimization.ts` - API endpoints for optimization
- `backend/src/tests/optimization.test.ts` - Comprehensive test suite

**Key Algorithms**:
- **Revenue Optimization**: `score(u, r, t_now) = revenue(r) - α*deadhead_miles - β*wait_time + γ*backhaul_bonus - δ*overtime_risk`
- **Backhaul Detection**: Finds efficient trip pairings within time/distance windows
- **Unit-Request Matching**: LOS compatibility, shift constraints, geographic limits

## 🔧 **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS**

### **Optimization Algorithm Formula**:
```
score(u, r, t_now) = revenue(r) - α*deadhead_miles - β*wait_time + γ*backhaul_bonus - δ*overtime_risk
```

### **Key Constraints**:
- LOS compatibility: unit_LOS ≥ req_LOS
- Time windows: travel_time + service_time fits in [ready_start, ready_end]
- Geography: distance within unit's max_radius
- Shift hours: assignments must fit within shift boundaries

### **Backhaul Detection**:
- Time window: 90 minutes maximum
- Distance: 15 miles maximum
- Direction: toward base preferred
- Revenue bonus for efficient pairings
