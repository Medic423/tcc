# Recovering the TCC project workflow (2025-09-25 11:27Z)

_**User (2025-09-25 11:27Z)**_

TCC Project Recovery Plan - September 25, 2025

Current Situation
The TCC project has experienced significant issues during the implementation of steps 4-5 of the trip creation workflow. The production branch is currently in a broken state with TypeScript compilation errors, and the development branch also has issues. However, the work is preserved in git history and can be recovered.

What Was Lost
- Steps 4-5 Implementation: Agency Selection and Review & Submit steps were partially implemented but caused TypeScript errors
- Working 3-Step Workflow: The original 3-step workflow (Patient Info, Trip Details, Clinical Info) was working perfectly
- Stable Production Environment: Both local and Vercel production deployments are currently broken

What's Preserved in Git
- Commit 399e887: "Add proper Vercel configuration for monorepo deployment" - Latest working state
- Commit 8939148: "Fix backend build for Vercel - generate all Prisma clients and disable strict TypeScript"
- Commit f87c722: "Restore production branch from external backup (Sep 24 10:06 AM) - stable working state"
- Commit cf5094a: "Restore working 3-step trip creation workflow" - This is the key commit with working 3-step form

Recovery Strategy

Phase 1: Restore Stable Base (30 minutes)
1. Create a new recovery branch from the last known good state:
2. cd /Users/scooper/Code/tcc-new-project
3. git checkout cf5094a
4. git checkout -b recovery/stable-3-step-workflow
5. git push origin recovery/stable-3-step-workflow


2. Verify the 3-step workflow is working:
3. # Generate Prisma clients
4. cd backend && npx prisma generate
5. cd backend && npx prisma generate --schema=prisma/schema-ems.prisma
6. cd backend && npx prisma generate --schema=prisma/schema-hospital.prisma
7. 
8. # Start servers
9. cd .. && ./scripts/start-dev-complete.sh
10. 
11. # Test at http://localhost:3000
12. # Login with: admin@altoonaregional.org / admin123
13. # Test the 3-step trip creation workflow


3. Deploy stable version to Vercel:
4. vercel --prod --yes


Phase 2: Implement Steps 4-5 Carefully (2-3 hours)
1. Create a feature branch for steps 4-5:
2. git checkout recovery/stable-3-step-workflow
3. git checkout -b feature/steps-4-5-implementation


2. Implement Step 4 (Agency Selection) incrementally:
    - Uncomment step 4 in the steps array
    - Uncomment the case 4 in renderStepContent
    - Add agency selection UI with notification radius
    - Test step 4 in isolation before proceeding

3. Implement Step 5 (Review & Submit) incrementally:
    - Uncomment step 5 in the steps array
    - Uncomment the case 5 in renderStepContent
    - Add review screen with trip summary
    - Test step 5 in isolation

4. Update validation logic:
    - Extend validation to include steps 4-5 requirements
    - Ensure proper form submission only on step 5
    - Test complete 5-step workflow

Phase 3: Testing and Deployment (1 hour)
1. Comprehensive testing:
    - Test all 5 steps individually
    - Test complete workflow end-to-end
    - Test with different user types (Healthcare, EMS, Admin)
    - Test form validation and error handling

2. Deploy to production:
3. git checkout production
4. git merge feature/steps-4-5-implementation
5. vercel --prod --yes


Key Files to Focus On
- frontend/src/components/EnhancedTripForm.tsx - Main form component
- frontend/src/components/HealthcareLogin.tsx - Login component
- backend/src/routes/auth.ts - Authentication routes
- backend/prisma/ - Database schemas and clients

Critical Commands for Recovery
# Kill all running processes
pkill -f "nodemon|vite|ts-node"

# Generate all Prisma clients
cd backend
npx prisma generate
npx prisma generate --schema=prisma/schema-ems.prisma
npx prisma generate --schema=prisma/schema-hospital.prisma

# Start development environment
cd ..
./scripts/start-dev-complete.sh

# Deploy to Vercel
vercel --prod --yes


New Chat Prompt for Recovery

I need to recover the TCC project from a broken state. Here's the situation:

**Current State:**
- Production branch has TypeScript compilation errors
- Development branch also has issues
- The 3-step trip creation workflow was working perfectly before attempts to add steps 4-5

**What I Need:**
1. Restore the working 3-step workflow (Patient Info, Trip Details, Clinical Info)
2. Carefully implement steps 4-5 (Agency Selection, Review & Submit) without breaking existing functionality
3. Ensure both local and Vercel production deployments work

**Key Commits:**
- cf5094a: "Restore working 3-step trip creation workflow" - This is the stable base
- f87c722: "Restore production branch from external backup" - Another stable point

**Files to Focus On:**
- frontend/src/components/EnhancedTripForm.tsx - Main form component
- backend/src/routes/auth.ts - Authentication (has TypeScript errors)
- All Prisma clients need to be generated

**Current Issues:**
- TypeScript errors: Property 'healthcareUser' and 'eMSUser' do not exist on PrismaClient
- Port conflicts and server startup issues
- Vercel deployment failures

Please help me:
1. First restore the stable 3-step workflow
2. Then carefully implement steps 4-5
3. Ensure everything works in both local and production environments

I need a methodical, step-by-step approach that doesn't break what's already working.


Lessons Learned
1. Always test incrementally - Don't implement multiple features at once
2. Keep working branches - Never work directly on production
3. Generate Prisma clients - Always run npx prisma generate after restoring
4. Test locally first - Verify everything works before deploying
5. Use external backups - The external drive backup saved us

Timeline Estimate
- Phase 1 (Restore): 30 minutes
- Phase 2 (Implement): 2-3 hours
- Phase 3 (Test/Deploy): 1 hour
- Total: 4-5 hours

Success Criteria
- ✅ 3-step workflow works perfectly
- ✅ Steps 4-5 are implemented and working
- ✅ All TypeScript errors resolved
- ✅ Local development environment stable
- ✅ Vercel production deployment working
- ✅ All user types can log in and create trips
⸻
Note: This recovery plan is based on the git history and the work documented in .specstory/history/2025-09-24_21-39Z-prepare-for-pages-4-and-5-implementation.md. The 3-step workflow was working perfectly, and we just need to carefully add the remaining steps without breaking the existing functionality. There are also past chats you can examine. If you can't see them tell me how to show them to you.

I'm planning a multi-step recovery that's quite complex. First, I should create a list of TODOs, then run terminal commands for tasks like creating branches,</details></think>
