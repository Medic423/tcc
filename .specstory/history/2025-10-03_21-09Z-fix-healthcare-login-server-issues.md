# Healthcare Login Troubleshooting - TCC Project

## Problem Summary
The Healthcare login (`admin@altoonaregional.org` / `upmc123`) is failing while TCC Admin and EMS logins work correctly. The issue appears to be related to backend server crashes due to TypeScript compilation errors.

## Current Status
- ✅ **TCC Admin Login**: Working (`admin@tcc.com` / `admin123`)
- ✅ **EMS Login**: Working (`fferguson@movalleyems.com` / `movalley123`)
- ❌ **Healthcare Login**: Failing (`admin@altoonaregional.org` / `upmc123`)

## What Has Been Tried

### 1. Authentication Service Fixes
- ✅ Fixed `HealthcareUser` model name casing (PascalCase → camelCase)
- ✅ Added extensive debugging logs to `authService.ts`
- ✅ Verified correct password (`upmc123`) from `create-healthcare-user.js`
- ✅ Confirmed user exists in `medport_hospital` database

### 2. Database Configuration
- ✅ Fixed `.env` file database names from `tcc_*` to `medport_*`
- ✅ Verified database connections (medport_center, medport_hospital, medport_ems)
- ✅ Confirmed Healthcare user exists in database

### 3. Backend Server Issues
- ❌ **CRITICAL**: Backend keeps crashing due to TypeScript compilation errors
- ❌ Server restarts continuously, preventing stable testing
- ❌ TypeScript errors in `src/index.ts` preventing server startup

## Current Error Details

### TypeScript Compilation Errors
```
TSError: ⨯ Unable to compile TypeScript:
src/index.ts(115,28): error TS7006: Parameter 'c' implicitly has an 'any' type.
```

### Backend Server Behavior
- Server starts, then immediately crashes
- Continuous restart loop
- Healthcare login attempts hit a broken server
- TCC Admin and EMS logins work because they were tested when server was briefly stable

## Root Cause Analysis
The Healthcare login failure is **NOT** an authentication issue. The problem is that the backend server is unstable due to TypeScript compilation errors, causing it to crash before the Healthcare login can be properly processed.

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priority
1. **Fix TypeScript Compilation Errors**
   - Resolve the `TS7006` error in `src/index.ts` line 115
   - Add proper type annotations to fix implicit `any` type
   - Ensure server can start and stay running

2. **Test Healthcare Login with Stable Server**
   - Once TypeScript errors are fixed, test Healthcare login
   - Verify the authentication flow works end-to-end
   - Confirm all three login types work consistently

### Secondary Tasks
3. **Investigate Server Stability**
   - Check why the server keeps restarting
   - Ensure nodemon configuration is correct
   - Verify no conflicting processes on port 5001

4. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - Test all three login types after fixes
   - Verify API endpoints are working
   - Confirm frontend can communicate with backend

## Expected Outcome
Once the TypeScript compilation errors are resolved and the backend server runs stably, the Healthcare login should work correctly, as the authentication logic has already been fixed and verified.

## Files to Check
- `backend/src/index.ts` (line 115 - TypeScript error)
- `backend/src/services/authService.ts` (Healthcare user lookup)
- `backend/package.json` (TypeScript configuration)
- `backend/tsconfig.json` (TypeScript settings)

## Testing Commands
```bash
# Test Healthcare login (once server is stable)
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"admin@altoonaregional.org","password":"upmc123"}'
```

## Notes
- The Healthcare user exists in the database with correct credentials
- The authentication service has been properly configured
- The issue is purely a server stability problem, not an authentication problem
- Once the server runs stably, all three login types should work correctly

_**Assistant (default)**_

I can see from the console logs that the backend server is indeed crashing and causing connection issues. The TypeScript compilation error you mentioned is preventing the server from starting properly. Let me investigate and fix this issue.

First, let me check the current state of the backend server and the TypeScript error:



---

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: backend/src/index.ts

---

I can see the issue! On line 115, there's a TypeScript error where the parameter `c` in the map function has an implicit `any` type. Let me fix this by adding proper type annotation:


---

Invalid: old_string and new_string are exactly the same.

---

Let me check the exact line again and fix the TypeScript error:


---

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: backend/src/index.ts

---

I can see the issue is on line 115. The TypeScript error is about the parameter `c` having an implicit `any` type. Let me fix this by adding proper type annotation:


---

Invalid: old_string and new_string are exactly the same.

---

Let me check the TypeScript configuration to understand why this error is occurring:


---

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: backend/tsconfig.json

---

The TypeScript configuration has `"strict": true` which means it's enforcing strict type checking. Let me check if there are any other TypeScript errors by running the TypeScript compiler:

Run this again. You stalled: cd backend && npx tsc --noEmit
