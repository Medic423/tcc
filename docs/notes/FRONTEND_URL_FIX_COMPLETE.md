# Frontend URL Fix Complete! ðŸŽ‰
**Date**: October 9, 2025  
**Status**: âœ… RESOLVED

---

## ðŸ”§ **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED & FIXED**

### **Problem:**
The frontend was still using the old backend URL (`https://vercel-8b6rz6p9x-chuck-ferrells-projects.vercel.app`) despite our code changes.

### **Root Cause:**
There was a `VITE_API_URL` environment variable set in Vercel that was overriding our `DEFAULT_PROD_URL` in the code.

### **Solution:**
1. âœ… Removed the old `VITE_API_URL` environment variable from Vercel
2. âœ… Set the new `VITE_API_URL` to point to the correct backend: `https://backend-7gq6yna1p-chuck-ferrells-projects.vercel.app`
3. âœ… Triggered a new frontend deployment to pick up the environment variable change
