# TCC Project: Post-Demo Architecture Migration Plan

**Created:** September 25, 2025  
**Demo Date:** September 30, 2025 (5 days from creation)  
**Purpose:** Comprehensive plan for migrating TCC from multi-database to single-database architecture after client demo

## Executive Summary

After the client demo on September 30, 2025, we will execute a phased migration from the current complex multi-database architecture to a simplified single-database approach for development, while maintaining production resilience options.

## Current Architecture Issues

### Multi-Database Complexity Problems:
1. **Schema Inconsistencies**: Different schemas between `schema-center.prisma`, `schema-hospital.prisma`, and `schema-ems.prisma`
2. **Development Overhead**: Complex database switching logic in `databaseManager.ts`
3. **TypeScript Compilation Errors**: References to non-existent fields (`phone`, `emailNotifications`, `smsNotifications`)
4. **Token Verification Failures**: Database column mismatches during authentication
5. **Production Mismatch**: Development complexity doesn't match production simplicity
6. **Maintenance Burden**: Three separate databases to maintain and synchronize

### Specific Technical Issues:
- `The column 'center_users.phone' does not exist in the current database`
- `The column 'trips.maxResponses' does not exist in the current database`
- TypeScript errors in `authService.ts` lines 67, 100, 139
- Runtime errors in `verifyToken` method during authentication

## Architecture Comparison

### Current Multi-Database Architecture (3 Separate DBs)

#### ✅ Advantages:
1. **Fault Isolation**: If TCC database fails, Healthcare and EMS can still operate
2. **Independent Scaling**: Each service can scale its database independently
3. **Security Isolation**: Healthcare data is completely separate from EMS data
4. **Reduced Blast Radius**: A problem in one database doesn't affect others
5. **Compliance**: Easier to meet HIPAA requirements with isolated healthcare data

#### ❌ Disadvantages:
1. **Complexity**: Multiple schemas, database managers, connection logic
2. **Development Overhead**: Maintaining 3 separate databases and schemas
3. **Schema Inconsistencies**: Different schemas can get out of sync
4. **Cross-Service Queries**: Difficult to query across services
5. **Production Mismatch**: Dev complexity doesn't match production simplicity

### Proposed Single Database Architecture

#### ✅ Advantages:
1. **Simplicity**: One schema, one connection, easier maintenance
2. **Development Speed**: Faster development and testing
3. **Cross-Service Queries**: Easy to query across all services
4. **Production Parity**: Dev matches production exactly
5. **Easier Migrations**: Single database to manage

#### ❌ Disadvantages:
1. **Single Point of Failure**: Database failure affects entire system
2. **Scaling Challenges**: All services scale together
3. **Security Concerns**: All data in one place
4. **Performance**: Single database handles all load

## Recommended Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Development Environment Migration (Post-Demo)

**Goal**: Simplify development environment to single database while maintaining production resilience

**Steps**:
1. **Update Database Manager**
   ```typescript
   // Simplify to single database for development
   const prisma = new PrismaClient({
     datasources: { db: { url: process.env.DATABASE_URL } }
   });
   ```

2. **Use Main Schema**
   - Use `backend/prisma/schema.prisma` (the comprehensive one)
   - Remove `schema-center.prisma`, `schema-hospital.prisma`, `schema-ems.prisma`
   - Ensure all fields are present in the main schema

3. **Update Authentication Logic**
   - Simplify auth logic to use single database
   - Remove database switching logic
   - Fix all TypeScript compilation errors

4. **Update Environment Configuration**
   - Use single `DATABASE_URL` instead of three separate ones
   - Update `backend/.env` to use single database connection

### Phase 2: Production Architecture Decision

**Options to Consider**:

#### Option A: Full Single Database Migration
- Migrate both development and production to single database
- Simplest long-term solution
- Requires careful consideration of resilience requirements

#### Option B: Hybrid Approach (Recommended)
- **Development**: Single database for simplicity
- **Production**: Keep multi-database for resilience
- **Shared Fallback**: Add a shared "emergency" database for graceful degradation

```typescript
// Production: Multi-database with fallback
class DatabaseManager {
  private centerDB: PrismaClient;
  private emsDB: PrismaClient;
  private hospitalDB: PrismaClient;
  private fallbackDB: PrismaClient; // Shared emergency DB

  async getCenterDB(): Promise<PrismaClient> {
    try {
      await this.centerDB.$connect();
      return this.centerDB;
    } catch (error) {
      console.warn('Center DB failed, using fallback');
      return this.fallbackDB;
    }
  }
}
```

#### Option C: Environment-Based Selection
```typescript
// Environment-based database selection
const useSingleDB = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' || process.env.USE_SINGLE_DB === 'true';

if (useSingleDB) {
  // Single database for development
  const prisma = new PrismaClient();
} else {
  // Multi-database for production
  const databaseManager = new DatabaseManager();
}
```

### Phase 3: Implementation Steps (Post-Demo)

#### Step 1: Fix Development Environment
1. **Backup Current State**
   - Run enhanced backup script
   - Document current multi-database setup

2. **Migrate to Single Database**
   - Update `backend/.env` to use single `DATABASE_URL`
   - Modify `databaseManager.ts` for single database
   - Use main `schema.prisma` for all models
   - Update authentication logic

3. **Fix TypeScript Errors**
   - Resolve all compilation errors in `authService.ts`
   - Ensure all field references exist in schema
   - Update Prisma client generation

4. **Test All Systems**
   - Verify all three login systems work
   - Test trip creation and management
   - Validate Healthcare and EMS workflows

#### Step 2: Production Decision
1. **Evaluate Resilience Requirements**
   - Assess if production needs multi-database isolation
   - Consider client requirements for fault tolerance
   - Evaluate scaling needs

2. **Choose Production Architecture**
   - Single database for simplicity
   - Multi-database for resilience
   - Hybrid approach for best of both worlds

3. **Implement Production Changes**
   - Update production environment variables
   - Deploy new architecture
   - Monitor system performance

#### Step 3: Documentation and Maintenance
1. **Update Documentation**
   - Document new architecture
   - Update deployment guides
   - Create troubleshooting guides

2. **Team Training**
   - Train team on new architecture
   - Update development workflows
   - Establish maintenance procedures

## Files to Modify

### Critical Files:
1. `backend/src/services/databaseManager.ts` - Simplify to single database
2. `backend/src/services/authService.ts` - Fix TypeScript errors and simplify logic
3. `backend/prisma/schema.prisma` - Ensure comprehensive schema
4. `backend/.env` - Update to single database URL
5. `backend/package.json` - Update database scripts

### Schema Files:
- **Keep**: `backend/prisma/schema.prisma` (main comprehensive schema)
- **Remove**: `backend/prisma/schema-center.prisma`
- **Remove**: `backend/prisma/schema-hospital.prisma`
- **Remove**: `backend/prisma/schema-ems.prisma`

### Environment Files:
- **Update**: `backend/.env` - Single `DATABASE_URL`
- **Keep**: Production environment variables for chosen architecture

## Risk Mitigation

### Before Migration:
1. **Complete Backup**: Run enhanced backup script
2. **Test in Staging**: Test single database approach in staging environment
3. **Rollback Plan**: Document rollback procedures
4. **Client Communication**: Inform clients of maintenance window if needed
