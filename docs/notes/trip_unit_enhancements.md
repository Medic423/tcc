## üîß **Technical Specifications**

### **Unit Assignment Format**
```
Display: "Agency Name - Unit Number"
Example: "Altoona EMS - Unit 439"
```

### **Trip Status Flow**
```
PENDING ‚Üí ACCEPTED ‚Üí IN_PROGRESS ‚Üí COMPLETED
```

### **Unit Status Management**
- `ON_DUTY` - Unit is available for assignment
- `ASSIGNED` - Unit is assigned to active trip
- `OFF_DUTY` - Unit is not available

### **New Database Fields**
```sql
-- TransportRequest table additions
arrivalTimestamp: DateTime?
departureTimestamp: DateTime?
```

### **API Endpoints**
```
GET /api/units/on-duty - Get available units for EMS agency
PUT /api/trips/:id/status - Accept trip with unit assignment
PUT /api/trips/:id/status - Mark arrival/departure
```

## ‚úÖ UI Testing Checklist (Phase 2)

### EMS Dashboard - Available Trips
- [ ] Clicking "Accept" opens Unit Selection Modal
- [ ] Modal lists on-duty units with number, type, capabilities, status
- [ ] Selecting a unit enables "Assign Unit"
- [ ] Assigning updates trip to ACCEPTED and moves it to My Trips

### EMS Dashboard - My Trips
- [ ] Accepted trip shows Assigned Unit number and type
- [ ] Status buttons show: Start Trip (ACCEPTED), Complete Trip (IN_PROGRESS)
- [ ] Start sets status to IN_PROGRESS and shows pickup timestamp (if present)
- [ ] Complete sets status to COMPLETED and frees unit (AVAILABLE)

### Units Tab
- [ ] Units reflect COMMITTED after acceptance
- [ ] Units reflect AVAILABLE after completion
- [ ] Toggling On Duty does not break assignment flow

### Error/Edge Cases
- [ ] Modal shows friendly error if assignment fails
- [ ] Decline on Available Trips still works and removes from list
- [ ] Refresh updates counts and lists without errors

### Cross-Checks
- [ ] Trip appears in PENDING before acceptance
- [ ] Trip appears in ACCEPTED after assignment
- [ ] End-to-end script passes locally (see FINAL_TEST_RESULTS.md)
**Blockers**: None identified
**Dependencies**: None
