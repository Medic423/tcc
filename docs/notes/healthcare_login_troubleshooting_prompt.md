# Healthcare Login Troubleshooting - TCC Project

## Problem Summary
The Healthcare login (`admin@altoonaregional.org` / `upmc123`) is failing while TCC Admin and EMS logins work correctly. The issue appears to be related to backend server crashes due to TypeScript compilation errors.

## Current Status
- ✅ **TCC Admin Login**: Working (`admin@tcc.com` / `admin123`)
- ✅ **EMS Login**: Working (`fferguson@movalleyems.com` / `movalley123`)
- ✅ **Healthcare Login**: Working (`admin@altoonaregional.org` / `upmc123`) - **RESOLVED**

## What Has Been Tried

### 1. Authentication Service Fixes
- ✅ Fixed `HealthcareUser` model name casing (PascalCase → camelCase)
- ✅ Added extensive debugging logs to `authService.ts`
- ✅ Verified correct password (`upmc123`) from `create-healthcare-user.js`
- ✅ Confirmed user exists in `medport_hospital` database

### 2. Database Configuration
- ✅ Fixed `.env` file database names from `tcc_*` to `medport_*`
- ✅ Verified database connections (medport_center, medport_hospital, medport_ems)
- ✅ Confirmed Healthcare user exists in database

### 3. Backend Server Issues
- ✅ **RESOLVED**: Backend server crashes due to TypeScript compilation errors
- ✅ Server now runs stably without continuous restarts
- ✅ TypeScript errors in `src/index.ts` resolved

## Resolution Details

### TypeScript Compilation Errors - RESOLVED
```
TSError: ⨯ Unable to compile TypeScript:
src/index.ts(115,28): error TS7006: Parameter 'c' implicitly has an 'any' type.
```
**Status**: Fixed by adding proper type annotations to the map function parameter.

### Backend Server Behavior - RESOLVED
- ✅ Server now starts and runs stably
- ✅ No more continuous restart loops
- ✅ Healthcare login now works correctly
- ✅ All three login types (TCC Admin, EMS, Healthcare) work consistently

## Root Cause Analysis - CONFIRMED
The Healthcare login failure was **NOT** an authentication issue. The problem was that the backend server was unstable due to TypeScript compilation errors, causing it to crash before the Healthcare login could be properly processed.

## Resolution Summary

### ✅ Completed Tasks
1. **Fixed TypeScript Compilation Errors**
   - ✅ Resolved the `TS7006` error in `src/index.ts` line 115
   - ✅ Added proper type annotations to fix implicit `any` type
   - ✅ Server now starts and stays running stably

2. **Tested Healthcare Login with Stable Server**
   - ✅ Healthcare login now works correctly
   - ✅ Authentication flow works end-to-end
   - ✅ All three login types work consistently

3. **Server Stability Restored**
   - ✅ Server no longer restarts continuously
   - ✅ Nodemon configuration is working correctly
   - ✅ No conflicting processes on port 5001

4. **Comprehensive Testing Completed**
   - ✅ All three login types tested and working
   - ✅ API endpoints are responding correctly
   - ✅ Frontend can communicate with backend

## Final Outcome - SUCCESS
The TypeScript compilation errors have been resolved and the backend server now runs stably. The Healthcare login works correctly, confirming that the authentication logic was properly configured all along.

## Files to Check
- `backend/src/index.ts` (line 115 - TypeScript error)
- `backend/src/services/authService.ts` (Healthcare user lookup)
- `backend/package.json` (TypeScript configuration)
- `backend/tsconfig.json` (TypeScript settings)

## Testing Commands - VERIFIED WORKING
```bash
# Test Healthcare login (now working)
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"admin@altoonaregional.org","password":"upmc123"}'

# Test TCC Admin login (working)
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"admin@tcc.com","password":"admin123"}'

# Test EMS login (working)
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"fferguson@movalleyems.com","password":"movalley123"}'
```

## Final Notes
- ✅ The Healthcare user exists in the database with correct credentials
- ✅ The authentication service has been properly configured
- ✅ The issue was purely a server stability problem, not an authentication problem
- ✅ All three login types now work correctly with the stable server
- ✅ **RESOLUTION DATE**: October 3, 2025
