# TCC Project Recovery - Continuation Plan for 10/04/25

## Current Status Summary

### ‚úÖ Completed in This Session
1. **Healthcare Login Issue - RESOLVED**: Fixed mock token issue in frontend
2. **Phase 0 - .env File Recovery - COMPLETED**: Verified correct database configuration
3. **Backup Created**: Enhanced backup with .env files to external drive
4. **All Login Types Working**: TCC Admin, EMS, and Healthcare all functional

### üîÑ Current State
- **Working Directory**: `/Users/scooper/Code/tcc-new-project` (git repository initialized)
- **Backup Available**: `/Users/scooper/Code/tcc-new-project-backup-20250922_105547` (git repository with all features)
- **External Backup**: `/Volumes/Acasis/tcc-backups/tcc-backup-20251003_175620` (complete project + databases)
- **Servers**: Backend (port 5001) and Frontend (port 3000) both running
- **Current Issues**: 
  - Backend experiencing TypeScript compilation errors with `agencyId` property
  - Frontend has merge conflict markers in Analytics.tsx
  - Notification system implementation deferred due to Twilio secrets issues

## Next Steps for 10/04/25

### Phase 0: Immediate Fixes (CRITICAL - Fix Current Issues)

#### Step 0.1: Fix Backend TypeScript Errors
```bash
# Fix agencyId property issue in authService.ts
# The User interface needs to include agencyId?: string
```

#### Step 0.2: Fix Frontend Merge Conflicts
```bash
# Remove merge conflict markers from Analytics.tsx
# Clean up <<<<<<< HEAD, =======, >>>>>>> markers
```

#### Step 0.3: Restart Servers Cleanly
```bash
# Kill all existing processes
pkill -f "ts-node\|nodemon\|vite"

# Restart backend
cd backend && npm run dev

# Restart frontend  
cd frontend && npm run dev
```

### Phase 1: Git Repository Initialization (COMPLETED)

#### Step 1.1: Initialize Git in Working Directory
```bash
cd /Users/scooper/Code/tcc-new-project
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit - Healthcare login fix applied with correct .env"
```

#### Step 1.2: Add Backup as Remote
```bash
git remote add backup /Users/scooper/Code/tcc-new-project-backup-20250922_105547
git fetch backup
```

#### Step 1.3: Analyze Available Features
```bash
# List all available branches
git branch -r

# Compare current state with main features
git diff backup/main --name-only
git diff backup/v1.1-stable-release --name-only
```

### Phase 2: Dependency-Ordered Feature Recovery

#### Priority Order (Test After Each Step):

**Order 1: Core Infrastructure**
```bash
# TypeScript compilation fixes
git cherry-pick backup/main 4f6670b  # Fix TypeScript compilation errors
# Test: npm run build in backend and frontend

# Database schema fixes  
git cherry-pick backup/main 2d5a437  # Add notification fields to schemas
# Test: Database connectivity and schema validation
```

**Order 2: Authentication and User Management**
```bash
# Authentication improvements
git cherry-pick backup/main 3ca7d21  # Agency Response System & TypeScript Fixes
# Test: All three login types (TCC Admin, EMS, Healthcare)
```

**Order 3: Core Business Logic**
```bash
# Agency response system
git cherry-pick backup/main 876d80f  # Basic API Endpoints Implementation
git cherry-pick backup/main c8aa9d4  # Frontend Integration for Accept/Deny System
# Test: Agency response workflow end-to-end
```

**Order 4: Notification System (DEFERRED - See notification_system_recovery.md)**
```bash
# ‚ö†Ô∏è  NOTIFICATION SYSTEM RECOVERY DEFERRED
# Issues identified:
# - Twilio secrets causing git commit problems
# - Incomplete Twilio configuration
# - Need proper secret management strategy
# 
# See: docs/notes/notification_system_recovery.md for detailed recovery plan
# 
# This will be implemented AFTER core recovery is complete
# to avoid breaking the main application
```

**Order 5: Analytics and Revenue Features**
```bash
# Analytics features
git cherry-pick backup/feature/analytics-route-optimization-completion 013b374  # Revenue settings
git cherry-pick backup/feature/analytics-route-optimization-completion bce2b96  # EMS Analytics
# Test: Analytics dashboard and revenue calculations
```

**Order 6: UI Improvements**
```bash
# UI cleanup
git cherry-pick backup/feature/ui-cleanup-phase2  # UI consistency improvements
# Test: All UI components and forms
```

### Phase 3: Testing Strategy

#### After Each Cherry-Pick:
```bash
# 1. Test TypeScript compilation
cd backend && npm run build
cd frontend && npm run build

# 2. Test database connectivity
curl http://localhost:5001/health
curl http://localhost:5001/api/test-db

# 3. Test all login types
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/auth/login -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"email":"admin@tcc.com","password":"admin123"}'
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/auth/login -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"email":"fferguson@movalleyems.com","password":"movalley123"}'
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/auth/login -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"email":"admin@altoonaregional.org","password":"upmc123"}'

# 4. Test frontend functionality
# Open http://localhost:3000 and test all dashboards
```

#### Rollback Strategy:
```bash
# If any test fails, rollback the last commit
git reset --hard HEAD~1

# Fix the issue and try again
# Or skip problematic commits and continue with others
```

### Phase 4: Consolidation and Final Backup

#### Step 4.1: Consolidate to Main
```bash
# Switch to main branch
git checkout main

# Merge all recovered features
git merge recovery/healthcare-login-fix

# Verify everything is working
# Run comprehensive tests
```

#### Step 4.2: Create Final Failproof Backup
```bash
# Run the enhanced backup script again
./backup-enhanced.sh

# This will create a new backup with all recovered features
```

## Critical Files to Monitor

### .env File Status
- **Current**: ‚úÖ Correct database names (`medport_*`)
- **Backup**: ‚úÖ Included in external backup
- **Git**: ‚úÖ Not in .gitignore (safe to commit)

### Key Commits to Reapply
1. **`4f6670b`** - Fix TypeScript compilation errors
2. **`2d5a437`** - Add notification fields to schemas
3. **`3ca7d21`** - Agency Response System & TypeScript Fixes
4. **`876d80f`** - Basic API Endpoints Implementation
5. **`c8aa9d4`** - Frontend Integration for Accept/Deny System
6. **`0eeb9c0`** - Complete notification system
7. **`15caeec`** - Fix phone number persistence
8. **`013b374`** - Revenue settings enhancement
9. **`bce2b96`** - EMS Analytics with agency-specific data

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All three login types working consistently
- [ ] TypeScript compilation without errors
- [ ] All API endpoints responding correctly
- [ ] Notification system functional
- [ ] Analytics dashboard working
- [ ] Revenue calculation features working
- [ ] Agency response system working
- [ ] UI components rendering without errors
- [ ] All features consolidated to main branch
- [ ] Final failproof backup created

## Emergency Recovery

If anything goes wrong:
```bash
# Restore from external backup
cd /Volumes/Acasis/tcc-backups/tcc-backup-20251003_175620
./restore-complete.sh

# Or restore from git backup
cd /Users/scooper/Code/tcc-new-project-backup-20250922_105547
git checkout v1.1-stable-release
cp -r . /Users/scooper/Code/tcc-new-project/
```

## Notes

- **Healthcare Login**: Already fixed and working
- **.env File**: Correctly configured and backed up
- **Database**: All three databases healthy and connected
- **Backup Strategy**: Enhanced backup includes .env files and databases
- **Git Strategy**: Will initialize git and cherry-pick features in dependency order

## Questions for Next Session

1. Should we start with Phase 1 (git initialization) immediately?
2. Are there any specific features you want to prioritize?
3. Should we test each feature individually or batch them?
4. Any concerns about the rollback strategy?

This plan provides a systematic approach to recover all lost features while maintaining the Healthcare login fix that's currently working.
