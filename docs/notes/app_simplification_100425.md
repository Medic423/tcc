# TCC Application Simplification Plan - October 4, 2025

## Executive Summary

Based on user feedback emphasizing the need for rock-solid core functionality, this document outlines a comprehensive simplification strategy for the TCC application. The focus is on streamlining the EMS module while preserving the essential workflow: **hospitals posting trips → EMS accepting trips → route optimization → backhaul → basic financial calculations**.

## Current Complexity Analysis

### EMS Dashboard Tabs (7 tabs total):
1. **Overview** - Trip summary and basic stats
2. **Available Trips** - View and accept trip requests
3. **My Trips** - Manage accepted trips
4. **Units** - Unit management and status
5. **Analytics** - Performance metrics and reporting
6. **Revenue Settings** - Complex pricing configuration
7. **Settings** - Agency profile management

### Database Complexity:
- **509 lines** in schema.prisma with 25+ models
- Complex financial tracking with `TripCostBreakdown` model (35 fields)
- Advanced analytics with `unit_analytics` model
- Multiple pricing models and optimization settings
- Extensive notification and logging systems

## Core User Requirements (KEEP)

### Essential Functions:
1. **Trip Management**
   - Hospitals post trip requests
   - EMS view available trips
   - EMS accept/decline trips
   - Basic trip status tracking

2. **Route Optimization**
   - Basic route calculation
   - Backhaul opportunity detection
   - Simple distance/time optimization

3. **Financial Basics**
   - Basic trip revenue calculation
   - Simple profit/loss per trip
   - Basic rate configuration

4. **Unit Management**
   - Unit availability status
   - Basic unit capabilities
   - Simple unit assignment

## Simplification Recommendations

### Phase 1: EMS Dashboard Simplification

#### **KEEP (Essential Tabs):**
1. **Overview** - Simplified trip summary
2. **Available Trips** - Core functionality
3. **My Trips** - Core functionality
4. **Units** - Basic unit management only

#### **REMOVE/SIMPLIFY (Complex Tabs):**
1. **Analytics** - Move to TCC Admin only, keep basic metrics in Overview
2. **Revenue Settings** - Simplify to basic rate configuration
3. **Settings** - Keep only essential agency info

### Phase 2: Database Field Simplification

#### **Trip Model - Fields to Comment Out:**
```sql
-- Complex financial tracking (keep basic revenue only)
actualTripTimeMinutes
backhaulOpportunity
completionTimeMinutes
customerSatisfaction
deadheadMiles
efficiency
estimatedTripTimeMinutes
insuranceCompany
insurancePayRate
loadedMiles
performanceScore
revenuePerHour
tripCost

-- Complex location tracking (keep basic locations)
destinationLatitude
destinationLongitude
originLatitude
originLongitude

-- Complex timing (keep basic timestamps)
responseTimeMinutes
requestTimestamp
```

#### **EMSAgency Model - Fields to Comment Out:**
```sql
-- Complex operational data
operatingHours
pricingStructure
serviceRadius
notificationMethods
requiresReview
approvedAt
approvedBy
latitude
longitude
```

#### **Models to Comment Out Entirely:**
1. **TripCostBreakdown** - Too complex for basic needs
2. **pricing_models** - Use simple rate structure instead
3. **route_optimization_settings** - Use basic defaults
4. **backhaul_opportunities** - Simplify to basic detection
5. **SystemAnalytics** - Move to TCC Admin only
6. **NotificationPreference/NotificationLog** - Use simple notifications

### Phase 3: Backend API Simplification

#### **Remove Complex Endpoints:**
- `/api/ems/analytics/*` - Move to TCC Admin
- `/api/optimization/*` - Simplify to basic route calculation
- Complex notification endpoints
- Advanced reporting endpoints

#### **Simplify Existing Endpoints:**
- `/api/trips` - Remove complex filtering and analytics
- `/api/units` - Basic CRUD only
- `/api/agencies` - Essential fields only

### Phase 4: Frontend Component Simplification

#### **Remove Complex Components:**
- `EMSAnalytics.tsx` - Move to TCC Admin
- `RevenueOptimizationPanel.tsx` - Remove entirely
- Complex notification components
- Advanced reporting components

#### **Simplify Existing Components:**
- `EMSDashboard.tsx` - Reduce from 7 tabs to 4 tabs
- `RevenueSettings.tsx` - Basic rate configuration only
- `UnitsManagement.tsx` - Basic status management only

## Implementation Strategy

### Option 1: Comment Out Approach (RECOMMENDED)
- Comment out complex fields in schema.prisma
- Comment out complex components and routes
- Keep code for future restoration
- **Pros**: Easy to restore, preserves work
- **Cons**: Codebase still large

### Option 2: Remove and Archive
- Remove complex code entirely
- Create separate archive branch
- **Pros**: Cleaner codebase
- **Cons**: Harder to restore, risk of losing work

### Option 3: Feature Flags
- Add feature flags for complex features
- Toggle off for simplified version
- **Pros**: Easy to toggle back
- **Cons**: Adds complexity

## Recommended Timeline (2 weeks)

### Week 1: Database and Backend Simplification
- **Day 1-2**: Comment out complex database fields
- **Day 3-4**: Simplify backend APIs and services
- **Day 5**: Test core functionality

### Week 2: Frontend Simplification
- **Day 1-2**: Remove/simplify complex UI components
- **Day 3-4**: Update EMS dashboard to 4 essential tabs
- **Day 5**: Final testing and cleanup

## Backup Strategy

### Before Starting:
1. Create full backup: `./backup-enhanced.sh`
2. Create git branch: `git checkout -b simplification-phase-1`
3. Document current state

### During Implementation:
1. Commit each phase separately
2. Test after each major change
3. Keep rollback plan ready

### After Completion:
1. Create final backup
2. Document simplified architecture
3. Update deployment plans

## Questions for User Response

1. **Database Approach**: Do you prefer commenting out fields (Option 1) or removing them entirely (Option 2)?

Comment out.

2. **Analytics**: Should we move all analytics to TCC Admin only, or keep basic metrics in EMS Overview?

Except for basic metrics move all the other analytics to TCC admin. 

3. **Revenue Settings**: What's the minimum revenue calculation complexity you need? Basic rates only or keep some advanced features?

Basic rates and costs. For example the cost of the crew. 

4. **Timeline**: Is the 2-week timeline realistic, or do you need it faster/slower?

2 weeks is good. 

5. **Rollback**: How important is it to be able to easily restore complex features later?

Most of the advanced features aren't working at the moment. We could keep what is tested and working. Restoring them later doesn't have to be easy. If the files are sepearted out into some sort of backup that would be fine. 

6. **Testing**: Should we test with real users during simplification, or focus on internal testing?

Real user testing. I'd like to create all the data by adding hospitals and EMS agencies so I can confirm that everthing is work from the start and I'm not mislead by test data.

7. **Deployment**: Should we deploy the simplified version to production, or keep it in development until fully tested?

Keep in development until fully tested. 

## ✅ IMPLEMENTATION PLAN - Based on User Responses

   // totalCosts: Decimal? @db.Decimal(12, 2)      // Comment out - complex  
   // profitMargin: Decimal? @db.Decimal(5, 2)     // Comment out - complex
   // Keep: totalTripsCompleted, averageResponseTime
   ```

2. **TransportRequest Model** - Advanced tracking fields:
   ```prisma
   // transferRequestTime: DateTime?               // Comment out
   // transferAcceptedTime: DateTime?              // Comment out
   // emsArrivalTime: DateTime?                    // Comment out
   // emsDepartureTime: DateTime?                  // Comment out
