# Phase 2: Vercel Postgres Database Creation Guide
**Date**: October 9, 2025  
**Status**: üîÑ IN PROGRESS

---

## üéØ **OBJECTIVE**

Create a Vercel Postgres database for the TCC backend and automatically link it to the backend project.

---

## üìã **STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS**

### **Step 1: Access Vercel Dashboard**

1. Open your web browser
2. Go to: **https://vercel.com/dashboard**
3. You should be logged in as **medic423** / **chuck-ferrells-projects**

---

### **Step 2: Navigate to Storage**

**Option A: From Projects View**
1. Click on your **backend** project in the project list
2. Click on the **Storage** tab at the top
3. Click **Create Database** button

**Option B: From Dashboard**
1. Click **Storage** in the left sidebar
2. Click **Create Database** button
3. Select **Postgres** as the database type

---

### **Step 3: Configure Database**

**Database Configuration Screen:**

1. **Database Name**: `tcc-production`
   - This is what you'll see in the Vercel dashboard
   - Can be anything descriptive

2. **Region**: Choose based on your users' location
   - **us-east-1** (Virginia) - East Coast USA
   - **us-west-1** (Oregon) - West Coast USA
   - **eu-west-1** (Frankfurt) - Europe
   - **Recommended**: `us-east-1` (if users are primarily East Coast)

3. **Pricing Plan**: Choose based on needs
   - **Hobby (Free)**:
     - 256 MB storage
     - Good for development/testing
     - 60 hours of compute per month
   - **Pro ($20/month)**:
     - 512 MB storage
     - Better for production
     - Unlimited compute
   - **Recommended**: Start with **Hobby** (free), upgrade if needed

4. **Connect to Project** (IMPORTANT):
   - ‚úÖ **Select**: `backend` project
   - This automatically links the database to your backend
   - Environment variables will be auto-created

---

### **Step 4: Create Database**

1. Review your settings:
   ```
   Name: tcc-production
   Region: us-east-1 (or your choice)
   Plan: Hobby (or Pro)
   Project: backend
   ```

2. Click **Create** button

3. Wait for provisioning (takes 30-60 seconds)
   - You'll see a progress indicator
   - Database will show "Ready" when complete

---

### **Step 5: Verify Database Created**

**You should see:**

1. **Database Overview Page** with:
   - Database name: `tcc-production`
   - Status: ‚óè Ready (green dot)
   - Region: Your selected region
   - Storage usage: 0 B (empty)

2. **Connection Details** (Important - we'll need these):
   - Database URL (will be masked)
   - Prisma URL (for connection pooling)
   - Direct URL (for migrations)

3. **Connected Projects**:
   - Should show: `backend` project linked

---

### **Step 6: Note Environment Variables**

**Vercel automatically creates these environment variables** in your backend project:

```
POSTGRES_URL              - Standard PostgreSQL connection
POSTGRES_PRISMA_URL       - Optimized for Prisma (connection pooling)
POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING  - Direct connection (for migrations)
POSTGRES_USER             - Database username
POSTGRES_HOST             - Database hostname
POSTGRES_PASSWORD         - Database password
POSTGRES_DATABASE         - Database name
```

**Plus it creates**:
```
DATABASE_URL - Alias to POSTGRES_PRISMA_URL (what Prisma uses)
```

**You don't need to copy these** - they're automatically available to your backend!

---

### **Step 7: Verify Environment Variables Created**

**In Terminal** (I'll do this for you):
```bash
cd /Users/scooper/Code/tcc-new-project/backend
vercel env ls
```

**Expected Output**:
```
POSTGRES_URL
POSTGRES_PRISMA_URL
POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING
DATABASE_URL
... (and potentially others)
```

---

## üéØ **WHAT HAPPENS AUTOMATICALLY**

When you link the database to the backend project, Vercel:

1. ‚úÖ Creates the Postgres database
2. ‚úÖ Generates secure credentials
3. ‚úÖ Creates all environment variables
4. ‚úÖ Links them to the backend project
5. ‚úÖ Makes them available for deployments
6. ‚úÖ Provides connection pooling URL
7. ‚úÖ Provides direct connection URL (for migrations)

**You don't need to manually configure anything!**

---

## üìä **DATABASE INFORMATION TO DOCUMENT**

Once created, note these details:

- **Database Name**: `tcc-production` (or what you chose)
- **Region**: (e.g., us-east-1)
- **Plan**: (Hobby or Pro)
- **Status**: Should be "Ready"
- **Linked Project**: `backend`

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT NOTES**

### **Don't Copy Connection Strings**
- Vercel manages these automatically
- They're encrypted and rotatable
- Available as environment variables
- Never hardcode them

### **Database is Empty**
- Newly created database has no tables
- Phase 5 will run Prisma migrations
- This creates all tables and schema

### **Free Tier Limits** (Hobby Plan)
- 256 MB storage (plenty for TCC)
- 60 hours compute/month
- Can upgrade anytime if needed

### **Connection Pooling**
- `POSTGRES_PRISMA_URL` uses pooling
- Better performance for serverless
- Prisma will use this automatically

---

## ‚úÖ **SUCCESS CHECKLIST**

After completing the steps above, verify:

- [ ] Database shows "Ready" status
- [ ] Database named `tcc-production` (or your name)
- [ ] Database linked to `backend` project
- [ ] Can see connection details (masked)
- [ ] Region selected matches your preference
- [ ] Pricing plan selected (Hobby or Pro)

---

## üö® **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **Can't Find Storage Tab**
- Make sure you're in the correct team (chuck-ferrells-projects)
- Storage might be under "Add-ons" or "Integrations" depending on UI

### **Database Creation Fails**
- Check your account has available databases (free tier allows 1-2)
- Verify billing is set up (even for free tier)
- Try a different region

### **Can't Link to Backend Project**
- Make sure backend project exists
- Try creating database first, then linking after

---

## üìù **NEXT STEPS (Phase 3)**

Once database is created:

1. Verify environment variables (I'll do this via CLI)
2. Pull environment variables locally (for testing)
3. Prepare for database migration (Phase 5)

---

## üéØ **WHEN YOU'RE DONE**

**Tell me:**
1. ‚úÖ Database creation successful
2. Database name you chose
3. Region you selected
4. Plan you selected (Hobby or Pro)

**Then I'll:**
1. Verify environment variables via CLI
2. Check database connection
3. Prepare for Phase 3 (confirming linkage)

---

**Ready to create the database!** Follow the steps above, then let me know when complete.
