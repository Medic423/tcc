# Accept/Deny Hospital Function - Multiple Agency Response Handling

## Current State Analysis

### Current Accept/Decline Functionality
Based on codebase analysis, here's how the current system works:

#### EMS Agency Side (EMSDashboard.tsx):
- **Accept Trip**: Updates trip status to `ACCEPTED`, sets `assignedAgencyId`, and `acceptedTimestamp`
- **Decline Trip**: Updates trip status to `CANCELLED` (this is problematic - should be `DECLINED`)
- **API Endpoint**: `PUT /api/trips/:id/status`

#### Hospital Side (HealthcareDashboard.tsx):
- **Current Display**: Shows trip status (PENDING, ACCEPTED, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED, CANCELLED)
- **Missing**: No visibility into which agencies responded or how they responded
- **Problem**: Only shows final status, not the response history

#### Database Schema (schema-center.prisma):
- **Current Fields**: 
  - `assignedAgencyId` (single agency)
  - `status` (single status)
  - `acceptedTimestamp` (single timestamp)
- **Missing**: No tracking of multiple agency responses

## Problems Identified

### 1. **Single Agency Assignment Limitation**
- Current system only tracks one `assignedAgencyId`
- No mechanism to track multiple agencies that responded
- First agency to accept "wins" - others are ignored

### 2. **Incorrect Decline Handling** ✅ **FIXED in Phase 1A**
- ~~Decline sets status to `CANCELLED` instead of `DECLINED`~~
- ~~This makes it appear the trip was cancelled rather than declined~~
- **RESOLVED**: EMS agencies now properly set status to `DECLINED` when declining trips

### 3. **No Response History**
- Hospital cannot see which agencies responded
- No timestamp tracking for individual responses
- No visibility into response patterns

### 4. **No Conflict Resolution**
- No mechanism to handle multiple acceptances
- No way for hospital to choose between agencies
- No notification system for competing responses

## Implementation Progress

### Phase 1A: Critical Bug Fix ✅ **COMPLETED**

#### **Problem Fixed**
- EMS agencies were setting trip status to `CANCELLED` when declining trips
- This made it appear trips were cancelled rather than declined by agencies

#### **Changes Made**
1. **Frontend (EMSDashboard.tsx)**:
   - Updated `handleDeclineTrip` function to send `'DECLINED'` status instead of `'CANCELLED'`

2. **Backend API (trips.ts)**:
   - Added `'DECLINED'` to valid status array in API validation
   - Updated error message to include DECLINED status

3. **TypeScript Interfaces**:
   - Updated `UpdateTripStatusRequest` interface in `tripService.ts`
   - Updated `Trip` interface in `TripsView.tsx`
   - Added DECLINED status to `getStatusBadge` function with orange styling

#### **Testing Results**
- ✅ API accepts DECLINED status (HTTP 200)
- ✅ Trip successfully updates to DECLINED status in database
- ✅ Invalid statuses properly rejected (HTTP 400)
- ✅ Frontend displays DECLINED status with orange badge
- ✅ Complete decline flow works end-to-end

#### **Git Commits**
- `e448f08`: Step 1: Update EMS dashboard to use DECLINED instead of CANCELLED
- `d01877f`: Step 2: Update API validation to accept DECLINED status
- `a88329d`: Step 3: Update TypeScript interfaces for DECLINED status
- `18e8194`: Step 4: Test complete decline flow - PASSED

## Proposed Solution: Multi-Agency Response Tracking

### Phase 1B: Database Schema Enhancement ✅ **COMPLETED**

#### **Changes Made**
1. **Trip Model Enhancements**:
   - Added `responseDeadline: DateTime?` - deadline for agency responses
   - Added `maxResponses: Int @default(5)` - maximum number of responses allowed
   - Added `responseStatus: String @default("PENDING")` - PENDING, RESPONSES_RECEIVED, AGENCY_SELECTED
   - Added `selectionMode: String @default("SPECIFIC_AGENCIES")` - BROADCAST, SPECIFIC_AGENCIES
   - Added `agencyResponses: AgencyResponse[]` - relation to responses

2. **AgencyResponse Model Created**:
   - `id: String @id @default(cuid())` - unique identifier
   - `tripId: String` - foreign key to Trip
   - `agencyId: String` - foreign key to EMSAgency
   - `response: String` - 'ACCEPTED', 'DECLINED', 'PENDING'
   - `responseTimestamp: DateTime @default(now())` - when response was made
   - `responseNotes: String?` - optional notes from agency
   - `estimatedArrival: DateTime?` - agency's estimated arrival time
   - `isSelected: Boolean @default(false)` - whether this response was selected
   - `createdAt/updatedAt: DateTime` - timestamps

3. **Relations Added**:
   - `Trip.agencyResponses -> AgencyResponse[]` - one-to-many
   - `EMSAgency.agencyResponses -> AgencyResponse[]` - one-to-many
   - `AgencyResponse.trip -> Trip` - many-to-one (CASCADE delete)
   - `AgencyResponse.agency -> EMSAgency` - many-to-one (CASCADE delete)

#### **Testing Results**
- ✅ Database migration applied successfully
- ✅ All new fields accessible and working
- ✅ Relations working correctly
- ✅ CRUD operations successful
- ✅ Default values working correctly
- ✅ Trip updates with new fields working

#### **Git Commits**
- `ff2b2b5`: Step 2: Add AgencyResponse model and Trip enhancements
- `2dbbf36`: Step 3: Apply database migration for Phase 1B
- `61c76c8`: Step 4: Test database schema changes - PASSED

### Phase 1C: Basic API Endpoints (Next)

#### New Table: `AgencyResponses`
```sql
CREATE TABLE "agency_responses" (
  "id" TEXT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
  "tripId" TEXT NOT NULL,
  "agencyId" TEXT NOT NULL,
  "response" TEXT NOT NULL, -- 'ACCEPTED', 'DECLINED', 'PENDING'
  "responseTimestamp" TIMESTAMP(3) NOT NULL,
  "responseNotes" TEXT,
  "isSelected" BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false,
  "createdAt" TIMESTAMP(3) NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  "updatedAt" TIMESTAMP(3) NOT NULL,
  
  CONSTRAINT "agency_responses_tripId_fkey" FOREIGN KEY ("tripId") REFERENCES "trips"("id") ON DELETE CASCADE,
  CONSTRAINT "agency_responses_agencyId_fkey" FOREIGN KEY ("agencyId") REFERENCES "ems_agencies"("id") ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

#### Enhanced Trip Table
```sql
-- Add new fields to existing trips table
ALTER TABLE "trips" ADD COLUMN "responseDeadline" TIMESTAMP(3);
ALTER TABLE "trips" ADD COLUMN "maxResponses" INTEGER DEFAULT 5;
ALTER TABLE "trips" ADD COLUMN "responseStatus" TEXT DEFAULT 'PENDING'; -- 'PENDING', 'RESPONSES_RECEIVED', 'AGENCY_SELECTED'
```

### Phase 2: API Enhancements

#### New Endpoints

##### 1. Agency Response Endpoint
```typescript
POST /api/trips/:id/agency-response
Body: {
  response: 'ACCEPTED' | 'DECLINED',
  responseNotes?: string,
  estimatedArrival?: string
}
```

##### 2. Hospital Response Management
```typescript
GET /api/trips/:id/agency-responses
// Returns all agency responses for a trip

PUT /api/trips/:id/select-agency
Body: {
  selectedAgencyId: string,
  selectionReason?: string
}
```

##### 3. Response Analytics
```typescript
GET /api/trips/response-analytics
// Returns response patterns, timing, etc.
```

### Phase 3: Frontend Enhancements

#### Hospital Dashboard Updates

##### 1. Enhanced Trip Display
- **Response Summary Tile**: Show count of accepted/declined responses
- **Response Timeline**: Visual timeline of agency responses
- **Agency Selection Interface**: Choose between multiple accepting agencies

##### 2. New Response Management Tab
- **Active Responses**: Trips with pending agency responses
- **Response History**: Historical view of agency response patterns
- **Agency Performance**: Response time analytics per agency

##### 3. Real-time Updates
- **WebSocket Integration**: Real-time updates when agencies respond
- **Notification System**: Alerts for new responses
- **Auto-refresh**: Automatic updates every 30 seconds

#### EMS Dashboard Updates

##### 2. Response History
- **My Responses**: History of all responses made
- **Response Status**: Track if response was selected or not

### Phase 4: Business Logic Implementation

#### 1. Response Workflow
```
1. Hospital creates trip → Status: PENDING, ResponseStatus: PENDING
2. Agencies receive notification → Can respond with ACCEPTED/DECLINED
3. First response received → ResponseStatus: RESPONSES_RECEIVED
4. Hospital reviews responses → Can select preferred agency
5. Agency selected → Status: ACCEPTED, ResponseStatus: AGENCY_SELECTED
6. Other agencies notified → Their responses marked as not selected
```

#### 2. Response Timeout Handling
- **Response Deadline**: Configurable timeout (e.g., 15 minutes)
- **Auto-decline**: Unresponsive agencies automatically declined
- **Escalation**: Notify hospital if no responses received

#### 3. Conflict Resolution
- **First-Come-First-Served**: Hospital can choose based on response time
- **Performance-Based**: Consider agency performance metrics
- **Geographic Priority**: Consider distance and availability
- **Manual Selection**: Hospital makes final decision

### Phase 5: Notification System

#### 1. Real-time Notifications
- **WebSocket Events**: 
  - `trip_response_received`
  - `trip_agency_selected`
  - `trip_response_deadline_approaching`

#### 2. Email Notifications
- **Hospital**: New agency response received
- **Agency**: Response selected/not selected
- **System**: Response deadline approaching

#### 3. In-App Notifications
- **Toast Messages**: Immediate feedback for actions
- **Badge Counters**: Number of pending responses
- **Status Indicators**: Visual status updates

### Phase 6: Analytics and Reporting

#### 1. Response Analytics
- **Response Time Metrics**: Average time to respond
- **Acceptance Rates**: Percentage of accepted vs declined
- **Agency Performance**: Response patterns per agency
- **Hospital Efficiency**: Time to select agency

#### 2. Reporting Dashboard
- **Response Summary**: Overview of all responses
- **Agency Comparison**: Side-by-side agency performance
- **Trend Analysis**: Response patterns over time
- **Export Functionality**: CSV/PDF reports
