# Trip Creation Additions: Pickup Location Implementation Plan

## Problem Statement

The current trip creation process lacks a critical field for specifying **where within the hospital** the patient should be picked up. This creates confusion for EMS agencies who need to know the exact pickup location (e.g., "Emergency Department", "First Floor Nurses Station", "Cancer Center") and contact information for that location.

## Current State Analysis

### Current Trip Creation Process (5 Steps)
1. **Patient Info** - Patient ID, weight, insurance, special needs
2. **Trip Details** - From/To locations (facility level only)
3. **Clinical Info** - Diagnosis, mobility, oxygen, monitoring
4. **Agency Selection** - EMS agency selection
5. **Review & Submit** - Final review

### Current Data Flow
- **From Location**: Currently just facility name (e.g., "Altoona Regional Hospital")
- **To Location**: Destination facility name
- **Missing**: Specific pickup location within the origin facility
- **Missing**: Contact information for pickup location

### Current Database Schema
- `fromLocation` (String) - Only stores facility name
- `toLocation` (String) - Only stores destination facility name
- No fields for specific pickup location or contact info

## Proposed Solution

### 1. Database Schema Changes

#### A. New PickupLocation Model
```prisma
model PickupLocation {
  id          String   @id @default(cuid())
  facilityId  String   // Reference to Facility
  name        String   // "Emergency Department", "First Floor Nurses Station"
  description String?  // Optional description
  contactPhone String? // Contact phone number
  contactEmail String? // Contact email
  floor       String?  // Floor number/name
  room        String?  // Room number/name
  isActive    Boolean  @default(true)
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt   DateTime @updatedAt

  // Relations
  facility    Facility @relation(fields: [facilityId], references: [id])
  trips       Trip[]   @relation("PickupLocation")

  @@unique([facilityId, name])
  @@map("pickup_locations")
}
```

#### B. Update Trip Model
```prisma
model Trip {
  // ... existing fields ...
  
  // Add pickup location reference
  pickupLocationId String?
  pickupLocation   PickupLocation? @relation("PickupLocation", fields: [pickupLocationId], references: [id])
  
  // Add pickup contact info (denormalized for performance)
  pickupContactPhone String?
  pickupContactEmail String?
  
  // ... rest of existing fields ...
}
```

#### C. Update Hospital Settings Dropdown System
- Add "pickup_locations" category to existing dropdown system
- Extend `DropdownOption` model to support contact information
- Or create separate `PickupLocation` management in Hospital Settings

### 2. Backend Implementation

#### A. New API Endpoints
```typescript
// Get pickup locations for a facility
GET /api/tcc/pickup-locations/:facilityId

// Create pickup location (Admin/Hospital)
POST /api/tcc/pickup-locations
{
  facilityId: string,
  name: string,
  description?: string,
  contactPhone?: string,
  contactEmail?: string,
  floor?: string,
  room?: string
}

// Update pickup location
PUT /api/tcc/pickup-locations/:id

// Delete pickup location
DELETE /api/tcc/pickup-locations/:id
```

#### B. Update Trip Service
```typescript
// Update EnhancedCreateTripRequest interface
interface EnhancedCreateTripRequest {
  // ... existing fields ...
  pickupLocationId?: string;
  pickupContactPhone?: string;
  pickupContactEmail?: string;
}

// Update createEnhancedTrip method to handle pickup location
```

#### C. Update Hospital Settings Service
- Add pickup location management to existing dropdown system
- Or create separate pickup location management service

### 3. Frontend Implementation

#### A. Hospital Settings Enhancement
- Add "Pickup Locations" category to existing Hospital Settings
- Allow hospital administrators to manage pickup locations for their facility
- Include contact information fields (phone, email)
- Support floor/room specifications

#### B. Enhanced Trip Form Updates

##### Step 2: Trip Details Enhancement
```typescript
// Add to FormData interface
interface FormData {
  // ... existing fields ...
  pickupLocationId?: string;
  pickupContactPhone?: string;
  pickupContactEmail?: string;
}

// Add pickup location selection after fromLocation
<div>
  <label className="block text-sm font-medium text-gray-700 mb-2">
    Pickup Location *
  </label>
  <select
    name="pickupLocationId"
    value={formData.pickupLocationId}
    onChange={handleChange}
    required
    className="w-full px-3 py-2 border border-gray-300 rounded-md shadow-sm focus:ring-green-500 focus:border-green-500"
  >
    <option value="">Select pickup location</option>
    {pickupLocations.map((location) => (
      <option key={location.id} value={location.id}>
        {location.name} {location.floor && `(${location.floor})`}
      </option>
    ))}
  </select>
  {selectedPickupLocation && (
    <div className="mt-2 text-sm text-gray-600">
      <p><strong>Contact:</strong> {selectedPickupLocation.contactPhone || 'N/A'}</p>
      <p><strong>Email:</strong> {selectedPickupLocation.contactEmail || 'N/A'}</p>
    </div>
  )}
</div>
```

##### Step 5: Review & Submit Enhancement
- Display selected pickup location with contact information
- Show pickup location details in trip summary

#### C. Trip Listings Updates

##### TripsView Component
```typescript
// Add pickup location column
<td className="px-6 py-4 whitespace-nowrap text-sm text-gray-500">
  <div className="flex items-center">
    <MapPin className="w-4 h-4 mr-2 text-gray-400" />
    <div>
      <div className="font-medium">{trip.fromLocation}</div>
      <div className="text-xs text-gray-400">
        {trip.pickupLocation?.name || 'No pickup location specified'}
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</td>
```
